# RPG Handy Helper

Welcome to the RPG Handy Helper!

This is a project that helps Game Masters as well as players to manage their RPG sessions.

This project is still in development. We are finishing up on the first version of the project, which currently allows to:
- create Your account with ability to pick Your profile picture
- create games with Your friends
- participate in game lobbies where You can roll dice - even some complicated combos! - chat with other players in the lobby - both for everyone else to see and in private, as well as participate in polls created by the game master - there is also a character sheet section and notes section where in the latter You can create notes as You play
- scroll through Your exisiting notes, edit them and create new ones
- participate in game schedulers in which all designated players can put there time in for Game Master to get the optimal time frame for next game with just one click
- play Your first campaign on a demo as a warmup before joining any games

There is more features coming, such as full character sheet management, automation of NPC creation, battle map and more! The ones we are working on currently or in the near future can be found in the `Issues` tab.

Additionaly, there is project's documentation that You can see under the `Wiki` tab. We'd like to also credit a bunch of libraries that we used in this project, that would be:
- SweetAlert2
- Tailwind CSS
- 3d-dice-box
- marked.js

Actual progress (which is equivalent to the `main` branch) can be found [here](https://rpg.adrian-goral.dev).
